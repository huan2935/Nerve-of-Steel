# Nerve of Steel Game
### MGTC28 In-Class Exercise 4
This is a timer program written in Python 

Nerve of Steel is a party game where players sit in a circle.  When the game begins:

1. The program displays "Players stand"

2. The program sleeps for a random time between 5 to 25 seconds.  While the program is sleeping, players can sit down.  Keep track of the last person to sit down.

3. When sleep is over, the program displays "Time Up.  Last to sit down wins."  Players still standing are eliminated, and the winner is the last person to sit down.

timer.py is a simple Python script allowing users to set timer duration.
Upon timer expiry, the user will see the time-up meme.
timer.py uses the **time library** to help keep track of time and the **pillow library** to facilitate the meme display.

Please see the documentation for the library used:
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)
- [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
